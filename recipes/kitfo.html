        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Kitfo is a traditional Ethiopian dish made from freshly minced raw beef, seasoned with mitmita (a spicy chili powder blend) and niter kibbeh (a clarified butter infused with herbs and spices). The dish is often compared to steak tartare but carries a distinctly Ethiopian flavor profile thanks to its rich, aromatic seasonings. Kitfo can be served raw (leb leb), lightly cooked, or fully cooked, depending on personal preference.</p>
        
        <p>Traditionally, kitfo is enjoyed with injera (a soft, sour flatbread) or kocho (a fermented enset bread), and is often accompanied by mild cheese (ayib) and cooked greens (gomen). It's a celebratory meal, typically served during special occasions or holidays, reflecting Ethiopia's deep-rooted culinary culture. The combination of tender beef, spiced butter, and vibrant sides makes kitfo a flavorful and memorable experience.</p>
