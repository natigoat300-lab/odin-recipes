        <h2>Description</h2>
           <p>Of all the vibrant dishes in Ethiopian cuisine, shiro wat holds a special place as a beloved comfort food. It is a thick, flavorful stew made from finely ground chickpea or broad bean flour, simmered with a generous amount of berbere spice blend, onions, garlic, and oil. The result is a stunningly simple yet deeply satisfying dish, boasting a velvety texture and a complex flavor profile that is at once earthy, spicy, and subtly sweet.</p>
           <p>More than just a meal, shiro wat is a staple found in homes and restaurants across Ethiopia, often enjoyed during fasting periods as it is vegan. It is almost always served atop injera, the spongy, sourdough flatbread that is a cornerstone of the cuisine. Using pieces of injera to scoop up the rich, orange-red stew creates a perfect bite that is both nourishing and deeply communal, embodying the very heart of Ethiopian dining.
